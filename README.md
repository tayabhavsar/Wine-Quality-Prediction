> Predicting Portuguese red wine quality using ensemble machine learning methods: achieving 81% accuracy while identifying actionable production thresholds for winemakers.

## 📊 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how machine learning can replace costly, subjective expert wine tastings with fast, objective chemical measurements. Using the UCI Wine Quality dataset (1,599 Portuguese Vinho Verde red wines), I developed and compared four predictive models to identify which physicochemical properties most accurately predict expert quality ratings.

**The Challenge**: Traditional wine quality assessment relies on expert sensory evaluation—a process that is expensive, time-consuming, and inherently subjective. Can data mining provide a reliable alternative?

## 🎯 Key Results

- **81.2% prediction accuracy** using Random Forest ensemble (AUC = 0.89)
- **Top 3 chemical predictors identified**: Alcohol content, volatile acidity, and sulphates
- **73% reduction** in required lab tests (3 vs 11 measurements) with only 3% accuracy loss
- **Actionable threshold discovered**: 10-11% alcohol content yields 85-90% probability of good quality
- **Cost-effective screening**: Minimal feature set enables rapid quality control during production

## 🔍 Research Questions Answered

1. **Can quality be predicted using only 3 measurements?**  
   ✅ Yes—alcohol, volatile acidity, and sulphates retain 95-97% of full-model performance

2. **Is alcohol alone sufficient, or are acidity measures necessary?**  
   ✅ Acidity measures are essential—alcohol alone is insufficient for reliable prediction

3. **What minimum alcohol percentage gives >50% probability of good quality?**  
   ✅ 8.4-10% depending on wine's overall chemical profile; optimal target is 10-11%


## 📈 Model Performance Comparison

| Model | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score | AUC |
|-------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|-----|
| Logistic Regression (Initial) | 54.4% | 0.544 | 1.000 | 0.705 | 0.500 |
| Logistic Regression (Improved) | 69.4% | 0.712 | 0.695 | 0.703 | 0.750 |
| Classification Tree | 74.1% | 0.758 | 0.744 | 0.751 | 0.780 |
| **Random Forest** | **81.2%** | **0.842** | **0.791** | **0.816** | **0.890** |
| Gradient Boosting | 77.7% | 0.801 | 0.767 | 0.784 | 0.843 |

**Winner**: Random Forest achieves the best overall performance with superior discrimination (AUC = 0.89)

### Three-Feature Model Performance

Using only the top 3 predictors (alcohol, volatile acidity, sulphates):

| Model | Full Features | Top 3 Only | Accuracy Loss |
|-------|---------------|------------|---------------|
| Logistic Regression | 69.4% | 67.5% | -1.9% |
| Classification Tree | 74.1% | 71.9% | -2.2% |
| Random Forest | 81.2% | 78.1% | -3.1% |
| Gradient Boosting | 77.7% | 75.0% | -2.7% |

**Result**: 95-97% of full-model performance retained with 73% fewer measurements required

## 🛠️ Methodology

### Models Implemented

1. **Logistic Regression**

   - Strength: Clear coefficient interpretation
   - Use case: Stakeholder communication

2. **Classification Trees**
   - Purpose: Threshold identification
   - Strength: Actionable decision rules
   - Use case: Operational quality control

3. **Random Forest** ⭐
   - Purpose: Maximum predictive accuracy

   - Use case: Production quality predictions

4. **Gradient Boosting**
   - Purpose: Handle class imbalance
   - Strength: Better calibration, sequential error correction
   - Use case: Probabilistic quality estimates

### Experimental Design

- **Data split**: 80% training (1,279 samples) / 20% test (320 samples)
- **Cross-validation**: 5-fold CV on training set

## 📊 Key Visualizations

### Feature Importance

![Feature Importance](results/figures/feature_importance.png)

**Top 3 Predictors Across All Models:**
1. **Alcohol** (32-35% importance): Strongest positive predictor
2. **Volatile Acidity** (16-18% importance): Strongest negative predictor
3. **Sulphates** (14-17% importance): Secondary positive predictor

### Alcohol Threshold Analysis

![Alcohol Threshold](results/figures/alcohol_threshold.png)

**Key Finding**: Quality probability increases non-linearly with alcohol content:
- 8.4% alcohol → 60-65% good quality probability
- 10-11% alcohol → 85-90% good quality probability (optimal target)
- 12%+ alcohol → 90-95% good quality probability (diminishing returns)

### Model Comparison

![ROC Curves](results/figures/roc_curves.png)

Random Forest and Gradient Boosting significantly outperform simpler models, with Random Forest achieving the highest AUC (0.89).

## 💼 Business Impact

### For Winemakers

- **Reduced costs**: Streamlined quality control requiring only 3 chemical tests
- **Production guidance**: Clear thresholds for harvest timing (target 10-11% alcohol)
- **Quality improvement**: Identified compensatory relationships (low alcohol can be offset by optimal acidity)
- **Faster decisions**: Objective measurements replace slow expert panels

### Practical Recommendations

1. **Harvest Timing**: Target grape ripeness for 10-11% alcohol potential
2. **Fermentation Control**: Monitor volatile acidity closely (strong negative predictor)
3. **Sulphate Management**: Optimize levels for preservation and flavor
4. **Quality Screening**: Use 3-feature model for rapid batch assessment

## 🔬 Technical Highlights

✅ Rigorous experimental design with proper train-test splits  
✅ Handled class imbalance (46.5% poor, 53.5% good quality)

## ⚠️ Limitations

- **Geographic scope**: Limited to Portuguese Vinho Verde wines
- **Quality range**: Dataset lacks extreme quality ratings (only 3-8 of 0-10 scale)
- **Class imbalance**: More medium-quality wines than excellent/poor
- **Temporal stability**: Single vintage; results may vary across years
- **Causal inference**: Models identify correlations, not causation

## 🔮 Future Work

- [ ] Expand to white wines and other varietals
- [ ] Incorporate multi-vintage data for temporal analysis
